Some web scraping scripts I made for a client, so that they could gather info about personnel in the Montgomery County school system.  
I didn't have to worry about anything being loaded in via JS, so I could scrape the site using mechanize instead of Selenium.  
Webpages in the school system's staff directory were read and the info was written in an output csv.
